# NetworkPolicy disabled for now - cluster allows all internal traffic
#
# The restrictive NetworkPolicies were causing issues because:
# 1. NamespaceSelector used `name: ingress-nginx` but namespace has `kubernetes.io/metadata.name: ingress-nginx`
# 2. Policies were blocking internal pod-to-pod communication
#
# If you need strict network policies in the future, ensure:
# - Use correct namespace label: kubernetes.io/metadata.name=ingress-nginx
# - Add DNS egress rules (kube-system namespace, port 53 UDP/TCP)
# - Add rules for all inter-service communication
# - Test thoroughly before applying in production
